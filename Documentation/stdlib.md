# STD Library Support
Ported std libraries are titled k_[stdlibname].h and k_[stdlibname].h. **SOME STD LIBRARIES WORK NON PORTED AND SOME MUST BE PORTED**

### Working Ported STD Libs
- k_string.h (fully working !!)
- k_stdio.h (file stream & related functions not ported)

### Known Working STD Libs*
- stdlib.h
- stdbool.h
- stdint.h
  
<sub>*"it works on my machine"</sub>

The next STD lib to be ported will be the time library, but this is most likely going to make a LONG time (no pun intended)
