# KoalemOS
### [Read the Docs](https://conorm110.github.io/KoalemOS/Documentation/docs)
KoalemOS is a os built on a custom kernel for i386 computers. It is not designed for normal everyday use; just for educational purposes.

I would love for this project to someday be a fully functional OS and kernel, but for now I'm just messing around with it.
