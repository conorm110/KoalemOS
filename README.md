# KoalemOS
### [Read the Docs](https://conorm110.github.io/KoalemOS/Documentation/docs)
KoalemOS is a os built on a custom kernel for i386 computers. It is not designed for normal everyday use; just for educational purposes.

As time goes on, the UEFI branch will include all BIOS features and become the main branch. BIOS will still be supported, however it will often be a bit behind.

I would love for this project to someday be a fully functional OS and kernel, but for now I'm just messing around with it.
